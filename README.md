# ParticlesCursorAnimation
The Particles Cursor Animation project showcases how to build an interactive animation where particles on the screen respond dynamically to the user's cursor movement. This project was developed as part of the Three.js Journey course, which offers a hands-on approach to mastering WebGL and Three.js.

## Features
+ Interactive particle effects
+ Cursor-responsive animation
+ Customizable particle appearance and behavior
+ Real-time rendering using Three.js and WebGL

## Technologies
+ Three.js: A powerful 3D JavaScript library used to render the particles and manage animations.
+ JavaScript: Core programming language.
+ WebGL: A web standard for rendering 3D graphics.
+ GLSL: For shader programming and particle effects.
